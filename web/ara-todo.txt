On the long term, the left 'burger' menu would disappear with a more intuitive frontend navigation
market dropdown
market box (tradeview box)
find a proper condition for 'there is no data to show' on different views
better profile page
better wallet page

Rob feedback :
    Market box : search input in header
    not incremental orderbook
